# Chunking, Embeddings & Semantic Search on Wikipedia Pages

This project involves implementing chunking, generating embeddings, and performing semantic search on Wikipedia pages. The goal is to extract meaningful chunks of information, create embeddings for these chunks, and enable efficient semantic search functionalities.
