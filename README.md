# Chunking, Embeddings & Semantic Search on Wikipedia Pages

## Overview

This project involves implementing chunking, generating embeddings, and performing semantic search on Wikipedia pages. The goal is to extract meaningful chunks of information, create embeddings for these chunks, and enable efficient semantic search functionalities.

## Notebooks:

Use notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to preprocess data, perform chunking, generate embeddings, and implement semantic search.

# Semantic Search Pipeline:


# Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

numpy

wikipedia-api

pandas

sentence-transformers

# Acknowledgments

This project aims to demonstrate the application of chunking, embeddings, and semantic search techniques on Wikipedia pages.
Special thanks to the developers and contributors of the Python libraries used in this project.
